First working day of 2018. I've decided to learn Java first and I've created a separate folder 'Goals' where I'll upload my materials.
I've already found a book 'Java 8 The Complete Reference' and I'll learn Java through this book. For a quick guide I've found Java overview pdf version.
All Java related guides and books are in Goals\Learn Java\Guides

Lets start the learning year!
